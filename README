EDIT: Bitcoin-spacific API has been moved to https://github.com/ThePiachu/GoBitcoinAPI .

This is a work-in-progress implementation of HTTP JSON-RPC in Google Go. Any help is appreciated.

Packages details:
-httpjsonrpc - package for using HTTP JSON-RPC
	+httpjsonrpcClient.go - currently contains a simple method for calling JSON-RPC through a HTTP POST
	+httpjsonrpcServer.go - currently contains a simple method for receiving JSON-RPC through a HTTP POST
	+test.go - leftover code - sample use, sample call with predefined parameters
-BitcoinJSON - sample uses of the httpjsonrpc package for Bitcoind server
-gaehttpjsonrpc - package for using HTTP JSON-RPC on Google App Engine
	+gaehttpjsonrpcClient.go - currently contains two simple method for calling JSON-RPC through a HTTP POST, one with Basic Access Authentication and one without
	+gaehttpjsonrpcServer.go - currently contains a simple method for receiving JSON-RPC through a HTTP POST
-GAEBitcoinJSON - sample uses of the gaehttpjsonrpc package for Bitcoind server

Progress so far:
-Simple calls are working
-Client packages have been tested on dev_appserver and Google App Engine a bit

Thanks to tux21b for the initial code.
Thanks to proppy for help with Google App Engine code problems
