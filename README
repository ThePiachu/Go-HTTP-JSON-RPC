This is a work-in-progress implementation of HTTP JSON-RPC in Google Go. Any help is appreciated.

Packages details:
-httpjsonrpc - package for using HTTP JSON-RPC
	+httpjsonrpcClient.go - currently contains a simple method for calling JSON-RPC through a HTTP POST
	+httpjsonrpcServer.go - currently contains a simple method for receiving JSON-RPC through a HTTP POST
	+test.go - leftover code - sample use, sample call with predefined parameters
-BitcoinJSON - sample uses of the package for Bitcoind server

Progress so far:
